# React Todos

Backbone's example [TODO app](http://backbonejs.org/docs/todos.html) with React JS
Components for views in place of `Backbone.View`.

## Demo

https://ssorallen.github.io/react-todos/

The demo uses local storage to save todos in the browser. The views are all rendered
with React, which means there is no dependency on another DOM manipulation library
like jQuery.

## Running Locally

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies

        $ yarn install
3. Run the local server

        $ yarn start

### Favicon

The great little todo list favicon comes from [Typicons](http://typicons.com/).
